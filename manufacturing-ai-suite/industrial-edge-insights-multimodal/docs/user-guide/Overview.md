# Overview

This application performs defect detection by integrating both vision and time series analytics. It utilizes camera-based visual inspection and sensor data analysis to identify anomalies in welding data. 

By combining results from image-based defect detection and time series anomaly detection using logical "AND" or "OR" operations, the system provides more robust and accurate identification of potential defects. This multimodal approach enhances reliability, reduces false positives, and supports smarter decision-making for maintenance.
